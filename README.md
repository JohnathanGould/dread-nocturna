# dread-nocturna
Dread Nocturna is a transmedia chronicle of resonance, rupture, and survival. When the Veil tears and a city feeds on power it can’t control, lives fracture across realities. Told through music, graphic chronicles, and fragments, the story unfolds in order—pressure building, rules eroding, and truth refusing to stay buried.
